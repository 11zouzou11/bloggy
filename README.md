<h1>1. User experience (UX)</h1>

<span id="ux-goals"></span>

### 1.1 Project goals 

- Making a full-stack site that  allows its users to comunicate with each other without a filter.

- Making a full-stack site that uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Flask.

- The users of the website can make use of CRUD (create, read, update and delete) for their profiles and posts

- the users can follow each other to see their latest posts 

<span id="ux-stories"></span>

### 1.2 User stories 

**First-time visitor goals:**

1. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to visit the website on every device, so that I can look at the website on desktop, mobile and tablet. 
2. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to navigate easily through the website, so I can find everything easily. 
3. As a first time visitor, I want to register an account on the website, so I can share my recipes on Breaktasty.
4. As a first time visitor, i want to find friends and family members.


**Site member goals:** 

All the goals of first-time visitors also apply for site members. There are additional user stories to the site members because they have more access to the website. See the additional user stories below.
1. As a site member, I want to find my friends easily.
2. As a site member, I want to be able to post stuff on the website freely.
3. As a site member, I want to be able to remove my posts if i want to.
4. As a site member, I want to be able to cusomize my profile

### 1.3 Design 

- #### Colour scheme 

The four colours that are used for the recipe website are very neutral and simple. I have chosen these colours because the colours give a sleek and uncluttered appearance.

- #### Fonts

The **Source Sans Pro**are used throughout the whole website. Sans serif and cursive are the fallbacks in case the main font isnâ€™t being imported to the site correctly. 


- #### Interactive design 

    - The website has to be easy to navigate. 
    - The user can quickly find the information he/she wants to find.
