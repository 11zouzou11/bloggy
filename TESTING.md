## 5. Defensive design 

1. The user is not able to break the site by clicking on buttons. 

**Answer 1:** All buttons on the website work. The buttons on the website consist buttons that lead to other pages or submit buttons to add, edit or delete something from the database.

2. The signup form: 
   - 2.1 The user has to provide a unique username.
   - 2.2 The user has to provide an email.
   - 2.3 The user has to double check the password.
